## Basic Setup for React App

`brew install node`
`brew install npm`
`npx create-react-app terminalsite --template typescript`

Then that's it. I have major inspiration from [react-terminal](https://github.com/bony2023/react-terminal) and [react-terminal-ui](https://github.com/jonmbake/react-terminal-ui). I'm not a frontend engineer, so I needed lots of examples.
Most, if not all, of the functionality is me.

I haven't set up automated tests yet, it's all been me. If you find a bug, I will gladly take any reports on the github,
but note that it could be an intended feature (probably not tho if it breaks stuff).

## Commands

These are commands I've implemented, they do NOT follow the man page specifications.

```bash
  cat
  cd
  clear
  echo
  help
  ln
  ls
  ps
  pwd
  start
  theme
  view-react-docs
  view-source
  whoami
```

## Old React Setup Stuff

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This is to make sure you have all of the expected dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

I think this section is new lol.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
